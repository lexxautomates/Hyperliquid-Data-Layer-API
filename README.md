# Hyperliquid Data Layer API

## The Rigged Game Ends Here

Wall Street has been playing a rigged game for decades.

They see your positions. They see your liquidations. They hunt your stops. They know exactly where to push the price to wipe you out.

But you? You've been blind.

When hedge funds open massive positions, you don't see it. When institutions are about to get liquidated, you don't see it. When smart money is accumulating, you don't see it.

**They see everything. You see nothing.**

That's how Wall Street has worked for your entire life. The house always wins because the house can see everyone's cards.

Until now.

## Enter Hyperliquid

Hyperliquid is building something different. An open financial system. A decentralized exchange that's already doing more volume than most centralized exchanges. A blockchain where everything is transparent.

They're calling themselves **the housecoin of all finance**.

Why? Because they're not just building another exchange. They're rebuilding the entire financial system on a foundation of transparency. On Hyperliquid, everyone can see what used to be hidden.

The liquidations? Visible.
The whale positions? Visible.
The smart money flows? Visible.

For the first time in history, regular traders can see what Wall Street has always seen.

## Why This Data Layer Exists

Here's the problem: Hyperliquid opened up all this data, but nobody built an easy way to access it.

Until now, there were **zero open node providers** creating a data layer for Hyperliquid. The data was there, but developers couldn't easily tap into it.

I'm Moon Dev, and I built this data layer because I believe in the vision.

My vision for Hyperliquid:
- **Billions of users** on an open financial system
- **Thousands of successful apps** serving those users
- **Millions of apps** being built by developers worldwide

But here's the thing: before we get a billion people on Hyperliquid, we need thousands of great apps. Before we get thousands of apps, developers need data. Easy data. Fast data. Real data.

**That's why I built the first open data layer for Hyperliquid.**

I'm already building the first major consumer app on this data layer - a Quant App that helps regular traders compete with institutions. It helps you take over liquidations, set intelligent limit orders, and manage risk in ways humans simply can't do manually.

But one app isn't enough. We need thousands of apps. And for that, we need thousands of developers with access to this data.

That's you.

## AI Swarm Agent (Supplementary Tool)

**Optional: Get analysis from 6+ AI models simultaneously.**

The main feature of this repo is the data layer API itself - the examples above show you how to access institutional-grade data. This AI Swarm Agent is a supplementary tool to help you understand and explore what's available.

This repo includes an AI swarm agent that can:
- **Chat** with a Director AI that understands all 40+ API endpoints
- **Propose** analysis plans using the available data
- **Execute** multi-model analysis via OpenRouter (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Qwen, and more)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Add to your .env (one key for everything!):
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run it!
python ai_agents/run.py
```

### Example Session

```
🌙 Moon Dev's Director Agent
==================================================

> What can I do with these APIs?

You can analyze Hyperliquid data including:
- Real-time liquidations from 4 exchanges
- 148 symbols with whale positions
- HLP sentiment (THE BIG ONE) - retail positioning signals
- Smart money vs dumb money rankings
- Order flow and trade data
...

> Is there a short squeeze brewing on BTC?

[PLAN]
1. get_hlp_sentiment() - Check retail positioning
2. get_liquidations("24h") - Recent liquidation pressure
3. get_smart_money_signals("1h") - Smart money activity

💡 Claude Opus 4.5:
Based on the HLP z-score of +2.3, retail is heavily short. Combined with
$45M in short liquidations over 24h, there's building squeeze pressure...

💡 GPT-5 Mini:
The sentiment data shows extreme short positioning. Smart money signals
are net bullish. Classic squeeze setup forming...

💡 Qwen3 Max:
Cross-referencing HLP delta with liquidation data suggests accumulation
by market makers while retail is betting against the trend...

## The Vision

Hyperliquid is building the housecoin of all finance.

I'm building the data layer that will help developers create the thousands of apps needed to onboard billions of users.

This isn't just about trading. This is about rebuilding finance. Transparent. Open. Fair.

Wall Street had their turn. Now it's ours.
